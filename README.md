# WMBA - Web Application

## About the Project
This is the repository for the web application that will be in development for the WMBA (Welland Minor Baseball Association). This project will aim to provide a tailored solution for the needs of the association and its community - from managing player registration and tracking game statistics, this application will serve as quality of life improvement to the volunteers working as coaches and organizers for this association
